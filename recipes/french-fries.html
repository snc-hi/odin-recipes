    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      French fries originated either from Belgium or France. They are prepared
      by cutting the potato into even strips, then drying and frying it, usually
      in a deep fryer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as
      part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack. They are often salted
      and may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or
      other local specialties.
