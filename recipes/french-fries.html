    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      French fries originated either from Belgium or France. They are prepared
      by cutting the potato into even strips, then drying and frying it, usually
      in a deep fryer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as
      part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack. They are often salted
      and may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or
      other local specialties.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients (Servings: 2)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak potatoes in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat dry
        thoroughly with paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees
        C). Gently add the potatoes in the hot oil for about 5 minutes, stirring
        and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Remove potatoes from oil with a
        slotted spoon to drain on paper towel and to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Fry the potatoes again until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Blot with
        a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.
